        <p>
          Hi! I'm Javier, and I'm passionate about the IT field. I'm experienced in systems architecture, cybersecurity, and infrastructure automation. 
          Throughout my career, I’ve participated in key projects such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Migration of services to cloud environments
          </li>
          <li>
            - Implementation of observability and secure deployments
          </li>
          <li>
            - Security reinforcement through hardening guides and SSDLC practices
          </li>
          <li>
            - Supporting developers to enhance their autonomy in "Cross DevOps" environments
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I currently hold the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification and I'm preparing for the Google Associate Cloud Engineer and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. On my training roadmap, I also have the CKS and AWS DevOps Engineer Professional.
          I believe in simple, effective solutions, well adapted to the real needs of the product and the team. I work hard to apply principles like KISS and to minimize technical debt, always with an analytical mindset and clear communication.
          If you'd like to know more about me (or just want to say hi), feel free to drop me a message. I'd be more than happy to hear from you.
          Thank you for reading, I hope you have a great day. 
        </p>
