        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Javier</strong>, and I'm <strong>passionate</strong> about the IT field. I'm experienced in <strong>systems architecture, cybersecurity, and infrastructure automation.</strong></p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I’ve participated in <strong>key projects</strong> such as:</p>          
        <ul>
          <li>- Migration of services to cloud environments</li>
          <li>- Implementation of observability and secure deployments</li>
          <li>- Security reinforcement through hardening guides and SSDLC practices</li>
          <li>- Supporting developers to enhance their autonomy in "Cross DevOps" environments</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>I currently hold the <strong>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)</strong> certification and I'm preparing for the <strong>Google Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE)</strong>.</p>
        <p>On my training roadmap, I also have the CKS and AWS DevOps Engineer Professional.</p>
        <p>I believe in <strong>simple, effective solutions</strong>, well adapted to the <strong>real needs</strong> of the product and the team. I work hard to apply principles like KISS and to <strong>minimize technical debt</strong>, always with an analytical mindset and clear communication.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to know more about me (or just want to say hi), feel free to drop me a message. I'd be more than happy to hear from you.</p>
